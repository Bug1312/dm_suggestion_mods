## Stattenheim Remote Dispesner Interaction

This mod makes it so when a Stattenheim Remote is in a Dispenser it will summon the TARDIS and is based on [suggestion #499](https://discord.com/channels/217396856550981633/273107511400464384/1074454495939010601):
> the Stattenheim Remote usable in a dispenser
>
> its mostly self explanatory instead of just being shot out of the dispenser it instead uses up durability and summons the Tardis linked to it facing the opposite direction
>
> this would allow a portable way to send your Tardis home if you don't have enough artron this could also just be a cool flex to just have all your Tardis's warp home

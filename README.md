## Introduction
This is a monorepo where each `mod/` branch is a Dalek Mod addon representing a suggestion inside the SWDTeam Community Discord's #suggestions channel, with the number being the Dynobot Suggestion #. 

Each mod will have it's own `README.md` with information and images.

Make sure to star this repository to get notifications on updates!

## What to expect
Mods created here -- and not a separate repository -- will be fairly low-effort. They will usually only ever get an initial update and a patch.

I will be deprioritizing large suggestions, dimensions, and structures.
If you want me to prioritize a particular suggestion, feel free to mention the # to me through discord, this repo's discussions, or my email (bug@bug1312.com).

## Using the repository
Downloading the entire monorepo at once be more than you actually want, make sure to use `--single-branch` in your git clone if you just care about one mod. Example: 
```
git clone https://github.com/bug1312/dm_suggestion_mods --single-branch --branch mod/1
```

## TARDIS Control Disc

This mod adds the Control Disc, a single-use unlock and summoning item for the TARDIS and is based on [suggestion #195](https://discord.com/channels/217396856550981633/273107511400464384/937548320237322261):
> Authorized TARDIS Control Discs.
>
> The TARDIS Control Discs can be seen as a single use Stattenheim remote/TARDIS key, working similarly to how the TARDIS key worked in DM 1.12, being able to summon and unlock a TARDIS it is bound to, allowing another player to use and pilot the TARDIS. (For one journey. Or something like that)
>
> Personally I think this is a good feature to allow other trusted "players" aside from yourself to access your TARDIS. This could allow players to escape from sticky situations without the pilot having to drop whatever they're doing to save them, especially when they're not AT the TARDIS. (Besides, trading coordinates can be kinda tedious). So simply make a control disc, bind it to a TARDIS, give it to a player, and problem solved!

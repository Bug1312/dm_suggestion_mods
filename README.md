## Teleporter Toggle

This mod changes the teleporter blocks so if either is powered, the teleporter will disabled and is based on [suggestion #194](https://discord.com/channels/217396856550981633/273107511400464384/937451366627020860):
> toggleable teleporters
>
> You could right click the teleporters with a tardis key to lock/unlock them or perhaps they could be toggled with redstone.
>
> It would make teleporters more secure on multiplayer if you wanted to say, make a teleporter to a secret vault that only you can go to, or maybe with redstone, a teleporter that only works after you solve a puzzle, ect

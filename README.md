## Fault Locator Hopper-ability

This mod adds the ability for hoppers to access the Fault Locator and is based on [suggestion #95](https://discord.com/channels/217396856550981633/273107511400464384/928845266923167845):
> The ability to use a hopper with the Fault Locator block.
>
> This would allow players to funnel items into and out of the "fuel" slot in the Fault Locator's GUI.
>
> It would let players put the fuel in a larger storage system and have it put into the Tardis over time via hoppers rather than putting the Bottled Artron in manually.

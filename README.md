## Chameleon Data Modules

This mod adds the ability to write chameleon exteriors to data modules and is based on [suggestion #205](https://discord.com/channels/217396856550981633/273107511400464384/939704118782615573):
> Data modules remember chameleon settings
>
> It would be very neat if data modules could also remember what exterior you used when writing the data module so you could for example, use the normal blue box exteriors normally but if you travel using a data module to X location , youd automatically switch to say, the blockstack exterior, because maybe that makes more sense for the location of the data module.

> It would make the chameleon circuit work more as a disguise like its supposed to and give the chameleon system a bigger gameplay feature than just being a cosmetic choice.

## Distanced TARDIS Un/Locking

This mod adds the ability to un/lock your TARDIS from a short distance (or anywhere inside the interior) with your key and is based on [suggestion #92](https://discord.com/channels/217396856550981633/273107511400464384/928787840446394388):
> Portably locking TARDIS
>
> The player would be able to lock their TARDIS "like a car" like 10 in The End of Time Part 1 by right clicking the air, within the same distance that would work with snapping the doors open.
>
> It would be useful to be able to unlock and snap the doors open from a distance rather than having to go up and unlock them making the snap redundant if you want to keep your TARDIS safe.

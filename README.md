## Laser / Gun Quickcharge

This mod adds the quick-change enchanment to all gun/laser weapons (that aren't the cannon) and is based on [suggestion #55](https://discord.com/channels/217396856550981633/273107511400464384/928229699551920138):
> Quick Charge Gunstick
>
> Allow the Quick Charge Enchantment to Work on the Dalek Gunstick (Not the Dalek Cannon, I Know that'd be OP as Fuck if so)
>
> Mainly so PvE is Easier to do at a Range with an Quick Charge Enchanted Gunstick

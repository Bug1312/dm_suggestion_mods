## TARDIS Siege Mode

This mod adds the ability to put your TARDIS into Siege Mode, allowing players to pick it up and move it around. This addon is loosely based on [suggestion #242](https://discord.com/channels/217396856550981633/273107511400464384/949191497037795368):

> TARDIS shrinks to a small box when is badly damaged

> Imagine being able to pick up the tardis when it's too damaged and placing it somewhere else to "heal" sorta speaking.
